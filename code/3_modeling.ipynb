    "\n",
    "1. Split the data into training and testing sets.  \n",
    "2. Transform the data using a Count Vectorizer or TF-IDF Vectorizer.\n",
    "3. Use an iterative Random and Grid Search process to train various models and transformers to find the best model and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "4. Use the final trained production model to determine whether the text came from r/WallStreetBets or r/Investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Pre-Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The title and selftext features in our datasets have already been lemmatized. We will further process the documents by tokenizing them (splitting sentences into individual, constituent parts) using two different transformers, a TF-IDF Vectorizer and a Count Vectorizer. By iteratively searching over the models and transformers, we will select the transformer that yields the most superior results. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.  TF-IDF Vectorizer  \n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF stands for *Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency* and is a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document or a collection of documents. ([SOURCE](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-tf-idf/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is calculated by multiplying how many times a word appears in a document by the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents. By doing this we can weight words by frequency and importance, such that a word that is very common in the subreddits, for example, *the*, will be ranked low even though it appears many times, and a word such as *Tesla* will be ranked higher as it has more relevance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Count Vectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "A count vectorizer is a simpler version of the TF-IDF Vectorizer. The count vectorizer simply creates a matrix of each word and its number of appearances in a collection of documents, and, unlike the TF-IDF vectorizer, does not penalize the words based on inverse document frequency. ([SOURCE](https://enjoymachinelearning.com/blog/countvectorizer-vs-tfidfvectorizer/))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to select the best possible model we will evaluate the effectiveness of 2 different transformers and 5 different classification models. We will evaluate the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is used to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a certain class. It does this by using a sigmoid function, returning values between 0 and 1 that can lead to a classification. Logistic regression is powerful and somewhat intuitive, however it is sensitive to outlier values, assumes a linear relationship between the features, and requires a balance of classes. [(SOURCE)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-logistic-regression/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. $k$-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "$k$-nearest neighbors renders a classification decision based on the average of a distance metric (euclidean distance or manhattan distance, etc.) amongst $k$-nearest neighbor points. The algorithm is simple and intuitive and can be powerful, however it is computationally expensive, prone to overfitting, and as it is distance based, is sensitive to scale of the features. [(SOURCE)](https://medium.com/swlh/k-nearest-neighbor-ca2593d7a3c4).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Random Forest Classifier/Extra Trees Classifer\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest Classifier is a type of decision tree algorithm. Decision trees make use *recursive partitioning*, wherein the data is repeatedly divided and subdivided with the goal of making the outcomes in each final subdivision as homogenous as possible. Homogeneity is assessed at each partition using a metric called *impurity*. For each proposed partition in the data, impurity is measured for each of the partitions that result from the split, and a weighted average is calculated. Whichever partition yields the lowest weighted average is selected. The tree stops growing when the leaves are completely pure. (Bruce, Bruce, Gedeck, *Practical Statistics for Data Scientists*, 2017)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Random Forests, multiple decision trees are used, wherein the decision trees are trained using a random subset of the features and a random subset of the training data. Each tree within the forest is trained using bootstrapped data (randomly drawn data sampled with replacement) from the original dataset. Thus the trees are relatively uncorrelated and the un-correlated decision trees render a classification as an ensemble, with the final classification being average combination of the decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra trees is very similar to a Random Forest, however the bootstrapping is eschewed. The advantage of a Random Forest over Extra-Trees is increased accuracy, however at the expense of extra computational time. ([SOURCE](https://quantdare.com/what-is-the-difference-between-extra-trees-and-random-forest/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is classification algorithm built on Bayes Theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way of calculating the probability of one (or more) event given the occurrence of another event (Conditional Probability) without knowing the probability of two (or more) simultaneous events (Joint Probability). \n",
    "\n",
    "For two events, $A$ and $B$, Bayes' theorem lets us go from $P(B|A)$ to $P(A|B)$ if we know the probability of an event irrespective of the outcomes of other random variables ( Marginal Probability ) of the outcomes of $A$ and the probability of $B$, given the outcomes of $A$. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A)\\ P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B)$ is referred to as the *Posterior Probability*, the conditional probability of A, given B.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A)$ is referred to as the *Prior Probability*, the marginal probability of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(B|A)$ is the conditional probability of B given A.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(B)$ is the prior or marginal probability of B, and acts as a normalizing constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes Classifcation works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculating the prior probability of each class\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculating the likelihood of each feature given each class\n",

    "**Randomized Search and Grid Search For Hyperparameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the 5 models and 2 transformers listed above have hyperparameters that can be tuned for greater model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to manage the tuning process in a rigorous yet practical manner we will use Randomized Search over the 5 models and 2 transformers to find the best performing model and parameters, and then pass that model into a GridSearch where we will more rigorously search over hyper parameters. Once our model and hyperparameters have been found, we will fit them to our training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized Search selects hyper parameters by sampling from a distribution of possible hyperparameters, but does not exhaustively use all combinations as a Grid Search will, and therefore is more efficient. Given our large datasets, time constraints and compute power, we believe this is the most practical and rigorous way to derive an effective model. \n",

    "### Title vs. Selftext vs. Both\n",
    "\n",
    "One result of the EDA conducted in [Notebook_2](code/2_eda.ipynb) was the significant difference between the words used in titles between the two subreddits, with one hypothesis being that titles alone might have better classification power than just selftext or the combination of the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "This possibility will be explored below. However, as the initial random search and gridsearch process is quite computationally expensive, we cannot repeat the process outlined above for titles, selftext and the combination of two. So, we will initially use all available data (combining titles and self text), search for the highest performing transformer and evaluator, and then iterate over titles only, selftext only and both to find the highest performing model. While this isn't truly exhaustive, it is the only possible approach given the resources and time constraints available to this project. "

    "The ROC curve is a quick visual way to assess the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. The closer the curve is to the upper-left corner, the better the performance of the model. Thus, we see that our model does quite well, as the worst possible model would lie along the 45 degree diagonal line, and our curve sits nicely in the upper left corner of the plot. \n",

If a classifier is a perfect classifier, it will have a score of 1.0, if a classifier is completely random, it will have a score of 0.5. We see that our model has an AUC score of .94, which is quite good. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a rigorous search and fitting process, we have labored to produce a classification model that can predict whether a post is from r/Investing or r/WallStreetBets with an 87% level of accuracy. This level of accuracy is even better than expected, given the overall level of similarity was assessed at 81% in [notebook_2](2_eda.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "From this iterative modeling process we can draw a few conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression was the best performing model across the training and testing data splits amongst the five models we evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The TF-IDF vectorizer's more nuanced approach to vectorization yielded better results than the Count Vectorizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We achieve better classification accuracy using title and selftext from subreddit posts rather than one or the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Our classification model breaks down when either subreddit uses general investment language. A r/WallStreetBets post devoid of profane language, references to options or short term investment strategies or any of the stock tickers frequently mentioned (such as TSLA or NKLA) becomes difficult to distinguish from a r/Investing post. Conversely, a r/Investing post that centers on options or tickers such as TSLA looks more like a r/WallStreetBets post to the classifier, and accuracy is lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a high-performance spam-bot would best be programmed to use words that are strongly-r/WSB in a majority of its posts if it was endeavoring to pantomime a r/WallStreetBets post. These words might include options, or other leverage-centric investments terms. The bot should also use emojis such as a '🚀', '🙌', '🐻', '🐂', '💵', '🍗','💎' to reiterate its points or use idiomatic r/WallStreetBets terminology such as \"Tendies\", Stonks\" or acronyms such as \"DD\" (due diligence). The usage of these phrases or terms lends a post the WallStreetBet-ness that general personal finance posts in r/Investing do not have. Conversely a spam bot can effectively miminc a r/Investint post by *not* using r/WallStreetBets language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, a reddit personal finance post is just any other personal finance post *unless* it uses a word like *tendies* and then it immediately self-identifies itself as r/WallStreetBets. "
